This is a configuration file for the PNI WP800 16A WIFI Smart Plug in ESPHOME so you can connect it to Home Assistant locally.
The plug is based on the bk7231t cip (WB2S) and it has power monitoring capabilities thanks to a hlw8012 power sensor. So at least in theory, this configuration file will work with any generic WIFI smart plug from Aliexpress that uses the WB2S chip.

The devices comes from factory with a Tuya proprietary firmware that you need to rewrite using Tuya Cloudcutter https://github.com/tuya-cloudcutter/tuya-cloudcutter
